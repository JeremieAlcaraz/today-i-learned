# TIL Title Rules

Simple rules for writing high-quality Today I Learned titles.

## Core Principles

**1. Start with an action verb**
- Use imperative form: `Install`, `Create`, `Check`, `List`, `Show`, `Get`, `Use`, `Set`, `Find`, `Run`
- ✅ "Install From Nonstandard Brewfile"
- ❌ "How to install from a nonstandard brewfile"

**2. Use Title Case**
- Capitalize all major words
- ✅ "List All Git Aliases From gitconfig"
- ❌ "list all git aliases from gitconfig"

**3. Be specific and descriptive**
- Include the tool/context when relevant
- ✅ "Open Current Tab In New Window With Vimium"
- ❌ "Open Tab In Window"

**4. Keep it concise**
- Aim for 3-7 words
- Remove unnecessary words
- ✅ "Show Used And Available System Memory"
- ❌ "How To Show The Used And Available System Memory On Your Computer"

**5. No punctuation at the end**
- No periods, exclamation marks, or question marks
- ✅ "Format A List Of Items By Locale"
- ❌ "Format A List Of Items By Locale."

**6. Focus on WHAT, not HOW**
- Title describes the capability, not the implementation
- ✅ "Jump Between Changes In Current File"
- ❌ "Use ]c and [c To Jump Between Changes"

**7. Make it searchable**
- Include key terms someone would search for
- ✅ "Difference Between Slice And Pointer To Slice"
- ❌ "Slice vs Pointer"

## Formula

```
[Action Verb] + [Specific Object/Target] + [Optional: With/Using Tool]
```

## Examples

**Good titles:**
- "Monitor Usage Limits From CLI"
- "Access Your GitHub Profile Photo"
- "Ensure Lookup Can Be Retried"
- "Run A Command With Specific Tool Version"
- "Set The Title Of A Window"

**Bad titles:**
- "How I monitor usage" (not imperative, includes "I")
- "github profile photo" (no verb, no title case)
- "Ensuring that a lookup can be retried" (gerund form, too wordy)
- "run command" (too vague, not title case)

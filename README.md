# Today I Learned

A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a variety of topics - from programming and technology to music, cooking, languages, and everything in between.

## Special Thanks

This repository was inspired by the amazing work of:

- [Josh Branchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) - for the original TIL idea and showing how to maintain a high-quality collection with excellent organization and clear, actionable titles
- [Simon Willison](https://github.com/simonw/til) - who spotted jbranchaud's TIL on Hacker News and demonstrated the power of learning in public
